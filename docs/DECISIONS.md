# Decisions

Non-obvious choices made during the build, newest last. Each entry: date, decision, reason,
alternatives considered. The "Fixed decisions" in `CLAUDE.md` are not repeated here.

## 2026-10-29 — Laravel 13 on PHP 8.4

- **Decision:** Build on Laravel 13 (the latest major) with PHP 8.4, locally, in CI and on the server.
- **Reason:** Laravel 13 supports PHP 8.3–8.5 and gets security fixes until Q1 2028. Laravel 12's
  security fixes end in February 2027, a month after the first school goes live. PHP 8.4 is
  mature enough that the SPEC packages support it.
- **Alternatives:** Laravel 12 on the existing local PHP 8.2.12 (rejected because it reaches end
  of life right after launch). PHP 8.5 (rejected for now because some packages may lag behind).
- **To confirm:** that Stellar Plus's cPanel "Select PHP Version" offers 8.4.

## 2026-10-29 — MySQL 8.0 everywhere

- **Decision:** Use MySQL 8.0 for local development, the `orange_sms_test` database and the CI
  service, to match the server.
- **Reason:** The XAMPP install has MariaDB 10.4. It behaves differently from MySQL 8.0 in places
  that matter here: JSON columns, default collations, and `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` locking
  (which admission and receipt numbers depend on). Tests should run on the same engine as production.
- **Alternatives:** XAMPP's MariaDB 10.4 (wrong engine, and end of life since 2024).
- **Note:** MySQL 8.0 itself reached end of life in April 2026. Ask Namecheap whether 8.4 LTS
  is available. Moving from 8.0 to 8.4 needs no code changes for this app.
